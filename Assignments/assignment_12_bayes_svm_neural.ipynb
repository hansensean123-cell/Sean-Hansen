        "\n",
        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "- Understand how to use classification models (Naïve Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks) to predict hotel cancellations.\n",
        "- Compare models in terms of accuracy, complexity, and business relevance.\n",

        "\n",
        "You work as a data analyst for a hospitality group that manages both **Resort** and **City Hotels**. One major challenge in operations is the unpredictability of **booking cancellations**, which affects staffing, inventory, and revenue planning.\n",

        "Your task is to:\n",
        "1. Build and evaluate three models: Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Neural Network.\n",
        "2. Compare performance.\n",
        "3. Recommend which model is best suited for the business needs.\n",

After one-hot encoding and dropping 'reservation_status' and 'reservation_status_date', the encoded DataFrame (df_encoded) has 119,390 rows and 248 columns. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features. Numerical features include lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_month, stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights, adults, children, babies, is_repeated_guest, previous_cancellations, previous_bookings_not_canceled, booking_changes, agent, company, days_in_waiting_list, adr, required_car_parking_spaces, and total_of_special_requests. Categorical features, before encoding, included hotel, arrival_date_month, meal, country, market_segment, distribution_channel, reserved_room_type, assigned_room_type, deposit_type, customer_type, reservation_status, and reservation_status_date. The following steps were taken to clean and prepare the data: Missing Value Imputation: Missing values in children and country columns were imputed with their respective modes. Missing values in agent and company columns were filled with 0. Feature Engineering: The reservation_status_date column was converted to datetime objects. Column Dropping: The reservation_status and reservation_status_date columns were dropped because they directly reflect the outcome (cancellation status) and are not suitable as predictive features. Categorical Encoding: All remaining categorical columns were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies) with drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity."

        "Model Performance and Metric: The model shows an overall accuracy of 0.54. However, for predicting hotel cancellations, recall for the 'canceled' class (class 1) is a more critical metric than overall accuracy. The recall for cancellations (class 1) is 0.91, meaning the model correctly identified 91% of actual cancellations. The precision for cancellations (class 1) is 0.45, indicating that when the model predicts a cancellation, it's correct about 45% of the time. The model is quite good at catching cancellations (high recall), but it also has a relatively high number of false positives (low precision for class 1).\n",

For example, specific combinations of lead time, deposit type, and special requests might signal a cancellation risk that's not obvious on its own.\n",

        "Minimizing Misclassification in Specific Cases (with careful tuning): If the business has a critical cost associated with one type of error (e.g., the cost of a false positive - contacting a guest who wasn't going to cancel - is high), SVM's parameters can be tuned to prioritize precision or recall for a specific class, offering more control over the types of errors made. This allows for more targeted interventions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Pros (Why they might be comfortable):\n",
        "\n",
        "Superior Performance: If the Neural Network consistently provides the most accurate and balanced predictions, leading to significant tangible benefits (e.g., reduced revenue loss from cancellations, optimized resource allocation), the business might prioritize performance over interpretability.\n",
        "Scalability: Neural networks can often scale well to larger, more complex datasets, which might be beneficial for future growth.\n",
        "Automated Decision Making: For high-volume, low-risk decisions (e.g., sending an automated email to a potentially canceling customer), the 'why' behind each prediction might be less critical than the overall effectiveness.\n",
        "Cons (Why they might be uncomfortable):\n",
        "\n",
        "Lack of Interpretability: Neural Networks are notoriously difficult to interpret. It's hard to explain why a particular booking is flagged for cancellation. Business users and decision-makers often need insights into the driving factors behind predictions to build trust, refine strategies, and comply with regulations.\n",
        "Regulatory/Ethical Concerns: In some industries, regulatory bodies may require models to be explainable to ensure fairness, prevent bias, and allow for auditing. Without clear explanations, it's hard to address questions like, \"Why was this customer treated differently?\"\n",
        "Troubleshooting: If the model starts to perform unexpectedly or produces an incorrect prediction, diagnosing the root cause can be very challenging without interpretability.\n",
        "Actionability: Without understanding why a cancellation is predicted, it's harder to devise targeted and effective intervention strategies beyond generic actions. For example, knowing which features contribute most to a cancellation risk could inform specific incentives or communication strategies.\n",
        "The ConvergenceWarning indicates that the optimization algorithm did not fully converge within the maximum number of iterations (200). While the model still produced good results, increasing max_iter or using a different solver might lead to even better performance or ensure full convergence, which is generally good practice, though it might increase training time. This is a technical detail that might further reduce business comfort if not properly explained and managed, as it implies the model might not have reached its optimal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, while the Neural Network offers the best predictive power, the hotel management would need to weigh this against the importance of understanding why a booking is likely to be canceled for operational insights and accountability. For critical decisions or explaining outcomes to customers, the 'black box' nature could be a significant hurdle"

Its superior accuracy (0.86) and balanced performance will significantly enhance your ability to anticipate and proactively manage potential cancellations, optimizing resource allocation and revenue.
